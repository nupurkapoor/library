## Resorce Library

Links, resources, training materials, blogs, github repos, articles, and everything that I don't want to get lost under my bookmarks folder! I'll probably arrange this as per language or concern, in respective sub folders, add a toc (hopefully one day!). This is a curated list of all the awesome not-to-be missed resources I've found online.

	- In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular 	programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.

	- This course provides an introduction to programming and problem solving using a high-level programming language. It is designed to increase your knowledge level to comfortably continue to courses CS111x. Our focus will be on generic programming concepts: variables, expressions, control structures, loops, arrays, functions, pseudocode and algorithms. You will learn how to analyze problems and convert your ideas into solutions interpretable by computers. We will use MATLAB; because it provides a productive environment, and it is widely used by all engineering communities.

*CUNY Hunter College*
	- It is currently an intensive introduction to program development and problem solving. Its emphasis is on the process of designing, implementing, and evaluating small-scale programs. It is not supposed to be a C++ programming course, although much of the course is spent on the details of C++. C++ is an extremely large and complex programming language with many features that interact in unexpected ways. One does not need to know even half of the language to use it well.

	- This is the graduate level complement to the ECS 122A undergraduate algorithms course by [Dan Gusfield](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/) in 2011. It assumes an undergrad course has already been taken in algorithms, and, while going over some undergraduate algorithms topics, focuses more on increasingly complex and advanced algorithms.

#Excerpts from the book 'Cracking the Coding Interview'

##The interview process
Once you are selected for an interview, you usually go through a screening interview. This is typically conducted over the phone. 
Don't let the name fool you; the "screening" interview often involves coding and algorithms questions, and the bar can be just as high as it is for in-person interviews. If you're unsure whether or not the interview will be technical, ask your recruiting coordinator what position your interviewer holds. An engineer will usually perform a technical interview.

Many companies have taken advantage of online synchronized document editors, but others will expect you to write code on paper and read it back over the phone. You typically do one or two screening interviewers before being brought on-site.

In an on-site interview round, you usually have 4 to 6 in-person interviews. One of these will be over lunch.The lunch interview is usually not technical, and the interviewer may not even submit feedback. This is a good person to discuss your interests with and to ask about the company culture. Your other interviews will be mostly technical and will involve a combination of coding and algorithm questions. You should also expect some questions about your resume.

Afterwards, the interviewers meet to discuss your performance and/or submit written feedback. At most companies, your recruiter should respond to you within a week with an update on your status.
If you have waited more than a week, you should follow up with your recruiter.

##The Evaluation Process
Most recruiters will tell you that candidates are evaluated on four aspects: **prior experience, culture fit, coding skills, and analytical ability**.
What this means for you is the following:
+ If people often perceive you as arrogant or argumentative or defensive, or with any other nasty adjectives, keep an eye on this behavior in an interview. Even an otherwise superstar candidate may get rejected if people don't want to work with them.
+ Spend some time preparing for questions about your resume. It's not the most important factor, but it matters. Even a little bit of time here can help you improve in major ways. It's a great "bang for your buck."
+ Focus mainly on coding and algorithm questions.

##Incorrect Answers
One of the most pervasive and dangerous rumors is that candidates need to get every question right. That's not even close to true.
First, responses to interview questions shouldn't be thought of as"correct" or "incorrect." When I evaluate how someone performed in an interview, I never ask myself, how many questions did they get right? Rather, it's about how optimal your final solution was, how long it took you to get there, and how clean your code was. It's not a binary right vs. wrong; there are a range of factors.

Second, your performance is evaluated in comparison to other candidates. For example, if you solve a question optimally in 15 minutes, and someone else solves an easier question in five minutes, did that person do better than you? Maybe, but maybe not. If you are asked really easy questions, then you might be expected to get optimal solutions really quickly. But if the questions are hard, then a number of mistakes are expected.
In evaluating thousands of hiring packets at Google, I have only once seen a candidate have a "flawless"set of interviews. Everyone else, including the hundreds who got offers, made mistakes.

##Top 10 mistakes
+ Practicing on a Computer
+ Not Rehearsing Behavioral Questions
+ Not Doing a Mock Interview
+ Trying to Memorize Solutions
+ Not Solving ProblemsOut Loud
+ Rushing
+ SloppyCoding
+ Not Testing
+ Fixing Mistakes Carelessly
+ Giving Up

##How to practice Technical Questions
+ **Try to solve the problem on your own**. Really try to solve it. Many questions are designed to be tough, that's ok! When you're solving a problem, make sure to think about the space and time efficiency. Ask yourself if you could improve the time efficiency by reducing the space efficiency, or vice versa.
+ **Write the code for the algorithm on paper**. You've been coding all your life on a computer, and you've gotten used to the many nice things about it. But, in your interview, you won't have the luxury of syntax highlighting, code completion, or compiling. Mimic this situation by coding on paper.
+ **Test your code—on paper**. This means testing the general cases, base cases, error cases, and so on. You'll need to do this during your interview, so it's best to practice this in advance.
+ **Type your paper code as-is into a computer**. You will probably make a bunch of mistakes. Start a list of all the errors you make so that you can keep these in mind in the real interview.

In addition, mock interviews are extremely useful. CareerCup.com offers mock interviews with actual Microsoft, Google and Amazon employees, but you can also practice with friends. You and your friend can trade giving each other mock interviews. Though your friend may not be an expert interviewer, he or she may still be able to walk you through a coding or algorithm problem.
