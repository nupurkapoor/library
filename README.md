## Resorce Library

Curated list of all the awesome donot-miss resources I found online. Links, resources, training material, blogs, github repos, articles, and everything that I don't want to get lost under my bookmarks folder! 

I'll probably arrange this as per language or concern, in respective sub folders, add a toc... hopefully one day!.
