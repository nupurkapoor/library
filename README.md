## Resorce Library

Links, resources, training materials, blogs, github repos, articles, and everything that I don't want to get lost under my bookmarks folder! I'll probably arrange this as per language or concern, in respective sub folders, add a toc (hopefully one day!). This is a curated list of all the awesome not-to-be missed resources I've found online.

	- In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular 	programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.

	- This course provides an introduction to programming and problem solving using a high-level programming language. It is designed to increase your knowledge level to comfortably continue to courses CS111x. Our focus will be on generic programming concepts: variables, expressions, control structures, loops, arrays, functions, pseudocode and algorithms. You will learn how to analyze problems and convert your ideas into solutions interpretable by computers. We will use MATLAB; because it provides a productive environment, and it is widely used by all engineering communities.

*CUNY Hunter College*
	- It is currently an intensive introduction to program development and problem solving. Its emphasis is on the process of designing, implementing, and evaluating small-scale programs. It is not supposed to be a C++ programming course, although much of the course is spent on the details of C++. C++ is an extremely large and complex programming language with many features that interact in unexpected ways. One does not need to know even half of the language to use it well.

	- This is the graduate level complement to the ECS 122A undergraduate algorithms course by [Dan Gusfield](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/) in 2011. It assumes an undergrad course has already been taken in algorithms, and, while going over some undergraduate algorithms topics, focuses more on increasingly complex and advanced algorithms.

	- This course taught in the MIT Independent Activities Period in 2009 goes over common solution to common interview questions for software engineer interviews at highly selective companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook. They cover time complexity, hash tables, binary search trees, and other common algorithm topics you should have already covered in a different course, but goes more in depth on things you wouldn't otherwise learn in class- like bitwise logic and problem solving tricks.

	- This is an advanced DS course, you must be done with the [Advanced Algorithms](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.854/current/) course before attempting this one.
	- [Lectures](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring14/lectures/) Contains videos from sp2012 version, but there isn't much difference.
	- [Assignments](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring14/hmwk.html) contains the calendar as well.

	- Advanced course in algorithms by Dr. David Karger covering topics such as amortization, randomization, fingerprinting, word-level parallelism, bit scaling, dynamic programming, network flow, linear programming, fixed-parameter algorithms, and approximation algorithms.

	- The required algorithms class that go in depth into all basic algorithms and the proofs behind them. This is one of the heavier algorithms curriculums on this page. Taught by Avrim Blum and [Manuel Blum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Blum) who has a Turing Award due to his contributions to algorithms. Course link includes a very comprehensive set of reference notes by Avrim Blum.
