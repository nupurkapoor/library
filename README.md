## Resorce Library

Links, resources, training materials, blogs, github repos, articles, and everything that I don't want to get lost under my bookmarks folder! I'll probably arrange this as per language or concern, in respective sub folders, add a toc (hopefully one day!). This is a curated list of all the awesome not-to-be missed resources I've found online.

	- CS10 is UCB's introductory computer science class, taught using the beginners' drag-and-drop language. Students learn about history, social implications, great principles, and future of computing. They also learn the joy of programming a computer using a friendly, graphical language, and will complete a substantial team programming project related to their interests.

	- In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular 	programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.

	- This course provides an introduction to programming and problem solving using a high-level programming language. It is designed to increase your knowledge level to comfortably continue to courses CS111x. Our focus will be on generic programming concepts: variables, expressions, control structures, loops, arrays, functions, pseudocode and algorithms. You will learn how to analyze problems and convert your ideas into solutions interpretable by computers. We will use MATLAB; because it provides a productive environment, and it is widely used by all engineering communities.
